## Features

- Use modern Promise-based `browser.*` APIs [webextension-polyfill][link-webext-polyfill].

- [Auto-publishing](#publishing) with auto-versioning and support for manual releases.
- [Extensive configuration documentation](#configuration).

## How to use this template

Click [<kbd>Use this template</kbd>](https://github.com/fregante/browser-extension-template/generate) and make a copy of your own. ðŸ˜‰

## Configuration

The extension doesn't target any specific ECMAScript environment or provide any transpiling by default. The extensions output will be the same ECMAScript you write. This allows us to always target the latest browser version, which is a good practice you should be following.

### Parcel 2

Being based on Parcel 2 and its [WebExtension transformer](https://v2.parceljs.org/recipes/web-extension/), you get all the good parts:

- Browserlist-based code transpiling (which defaults to just the latest Chrome and Firefox versions)
- Automatically picks up any new file specified in `manifest.json`
- Adding TypeScript support is as easy as renaming your files to `.ts`; [sindresorhus/tsconfig][link-tsconfig] is also advised in that case.

### Auto-syncing options

Options are managed by [fregante/webext-options-sync][link-options-sync], which auto-saves and auto-restores the options form, applies defaults and runs migrations.

### Publishing

It's possible to automatically publish to both the Chrome Web Store and Mozilla Addons at once by adding these secrets on GitHub Actions:

1. `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `REFRESH_TOKEN` from [Google APIs][link-cws-keys].
2. `WEB_EXT_API_KEY`, and `WEB_EXT_API_SECRET` from [AMO][link-amo-keys].

The GitHub Actions workflow will:

1. Build the extension
2. Create a version number based on the current UTC date time, like [`19.6.16`](https://github.com/fregante/daily-version-action) and sets it in the manifest.json
3. Deploy it to both stores

#### Auto-publishing

Thanks to the included [GitHub Action Workflows](.github/workflows), if you set up those secrets in the repo's Settings, the deployment will automatically happen:

- on a schedule, by default [every week](.github/workflows/deploy-automatic.yml) (but only if there are any new commits in the last tag)
- manually, by clicking ["Run workflow"](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/) in the Actions tab.
