> A template for creating cross-browser browser extensions

![Sample extension output](media/previewer.png)

## Features
- Cross-browser builds using [webextension-polyfill][link-webext-polyfill].
- [Auto-syncing options](#auto-syncing-options).
- [Auto-publishing](#auto-publishing) with auto-versioning and support for manual releases.
- Option to publish on [Git tags](#releases-on-git-tags) instead of auto-publishing.
- [Extensive configuration documentation](#configuration).

This extension template is heavily inspired from [refined-github][link-rgh], [notifier-for-github][link-ngh], and [hide-files-on-github][link-hfog] browser extensions. You can always refer to these browser extensions' source code if you find anything confusing on how to create a new extension.

## How to use this template

Click <kbd>Use this template</kbd> and make a copy of your own. ðŸ˜‰

## Configuration

The extension doesn't target any specific ECMAScript environment or provide any transpiling by default. The extensions output will be the same ECMAScript you write. This allows us to always target the latest browser version, which is a good practice you should be following.

### Webpack

#### Transpiling using Babel

The template bakes in a pretty basic webpack config, with no transpiling. To setup transpiling using Babel follow the following configuration steps.

1. Install Babel packages and respective loader for webpack.

	``` sh
	npm i --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader
	```
1. In `webpack.config.js`, add the following rule to process JS files.

	``` js
	module: {
		rules: [
			{
				test: /\.js$/,
				exclude: /node_modules/,
				loader: 'babel-loader'
			}
		]
	}
	```
1. Target respective browsers using `.babelrc`.

	``` json
	{
		"presets": [
			["@babel/preset-env", {
				"targets": {
					"chrome": "74",
					"firefox": "67"
				}
			}]
		]
	}
	```

#### Extracting CSS

If you will be writing any code that will be importing CSS files from JS files, then you will be needing `mini-css-extract-plugin` to extract this imported CSS into its own file.

1. Install the webpack plugin.

	``` sh
	npm i --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin
	```
1. Modify the webpack config as mentioned to let this plugin handle CSS imports.

	``` js
	// Import plugin
	const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');

	// Under `module.rules`
	{
		test: /\.css$/,
		use: [
			MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
			'css-loader'
		]
	}

	// Under `plugins`
	new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
		filename: 'features.css'
	})
	```

#### TypeScript

TypeScript and Babel configs conflict each other, so you can only use one of these configuration types at any point.

1. Install TypeScript and respective loader for webpack

	``` sh
	npm i --save-dev typescript ts-loader @types/firefox-webext-browser
	```
1. Use the following webpack rule in the config file.

	``` js
	{
		test: /\.(js|ts|tsx)$/,
		loader: 'ts-loader',
		exclude: /node_modules/
	},
	```

1. Use the following as `tsconfig.json`, uses [sindresorhus/tsconfig][link-tsconfig] (install it as dependecy before using).

	``` json
	{
		"extends": "@sindresorhus/tsconfig",
		"compilerOptions": {
			"target": "esnext",
			"declaration": false
		},
		"include": [
			"source"
		]
	}
	```

TypeScript requires additional configuration depending on how you set it up, like [linting][link-xo-ts].

### Contentscripts

Contentscripts are CSS and JS code that you inject into each tab of the browser. Instead of manually using the API to tell the browser to inject these scripts, you could use [bfred-it/webext-dynamic-content-scripts][link-dcs] to automatically do this.

### Auto-syncing options

The options page includes [bfred-it/webext-options-sync][link-options-sync] that syncs all input values includes in the form element as they change. These changes are reflected across all the browser instances for the extension if you are logged into the browser using Google account on Chrome or Firefox account on Firefox.

Refer to the Node modules documentation for more info on how it works.

### Auto-publishing

The included [Travis file](.travis.yml) includes config to test the repo on merges to master and includes as deplpyment script to create and publish a new version of the extension only if the following conditions are met

1. If the Travis build is triggered using the "Trigger build" button on the Travis website, this allows for [manual releases](#manual-releases).
2. Or if the Travis build is part of a cron job and only there are any commits in the last 26 hours.

To setup this auto-publishing, you have to export some API keys from Chrome Web Store (CWS) and Mozilla Extention Store (AMO), and set these as environment variables in your Travis settings.

1. `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `REFRESH_TOKEN` from [Google APIs][link-cws-keys].
1. `WEB_EXT_API_KEY`, and `WEB_EXT_API_SECRET` from [AMO][link-amo-keys].

And don't forget to setup a cron job that runs daily on master, and include your CWS extension id in [.travis.yml](.travis.yml).

#### Versioning

Whenever you want to create a new release or when the extension is auto-published, the current date and time in the format `[year].[month].[date].[hour-minute]` (for example, `19.6.16.428`) is used as the version number. So that you don't have to manually update this number when a new release is to be made.

#### Manual releases

Releases to the extension are made from the cron job that runs once a day. If you ever wanted to release a new version, like an immediate bug/security fix, you can use the "Trigger build" button on the Travis build page after making the necessary commits. This will trigger the release script and new version will be published with the versioning method mentioned above.

### Releases on Git tags

You can also set up Travis to release extension on Git tags if you don't want the extension to auto-publish itself. In that case the version with which the extension is released will be same as current Git tag.

To set it up, set the environment variable `RELEASE_ON_TAGS` to `true` in [.travis.yml](.travis.yml). In this case, [automatic daily releases](#auto-publishing) and its respective [versioning](#versioning) method will not be triggered.

### License

This browser extension template is released under [MIT](#license) and mentioned below. There is no `license` file included in here, but when you clone this template, you should include your own license file for the specific license you choose to use.

### Tests

I know, everyone has their own opinion on this one. To keep it simple, copy-paste tests and their configuration from the extension projects mentioned at the start of this document. End of story.
